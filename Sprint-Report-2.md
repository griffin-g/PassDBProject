# Sprint x Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Complete imports of wordlists
 * Exact password matching
 * Password strength
 * Similar password matching

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint, I refined the imports of wordlists to the database. I also added and completed queries for the backend to pass to the database to be visualized in the GUI. A password strength metric was developed out of a 10 point total. 

## Unfinished Work
Completing the transition from purely wordlists and removing breaches has not been completed in this sprint. My primary focus was on the passwords and products.
